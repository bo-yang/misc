misc
====

This folder contains a collection of misc tools I developed for personal use. Hopefully they may also save others' efforts when they meet similar problems. Anyone can use any tool in this folder for any purpose. However, there is no guarantee for the correctness. If you have any problem, please send me an E-mail: bonny95@gmail.com.

Collection 1: Automatic Program Checking
	- process_Baci_prog.sh & check_rw_sequence.pl: tools to automatically build and run BACI programs. The output can be checked by tool check_rw_sequence.pl. 
	- process_racket.sh: automatically run racket program and check for errors. It suppose the test commands and expected outputs are stored in file test_cmds.rkt.
